<p>I’m Dr. Phil Chodrow, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. My pronouns are he/him/his. I grew up in Virginia, did undergrad at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, and did my PhD (after a few years traveling and working) at MIT. Then I came here to UCLA!</p>
<p>I love applied math, ethical data science, Star Trek, penguins, cooking, tea, Studio Ghibli movies, traditional martial arts, and effective pedagogy.</p>
<div id="how-to-address-me" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>How to Address Me<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-address-me"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure, please call me “Professor Chodrow.” I usually invite Learning Assistants and student research collaborators to address me as “Phil.”</p>
<p>Please remember to address all your professors respectfully and according to their preferences. As argued in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048538/pdf/pnas.201805284.pdf">recent study</a>, many of us have harmful, gendered biases about when we use earned titles like “Dr.” or “Professor.” A small, simple thing you can do to make academia a more equitable place is to check your own potential biases. If you’re not sure, “Professor X” or “Dr. X” is always a safe choice — but even better is to just ask what your instructor prefers! My own personal preference is related to <a href="https://pressfolios-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/story_pdf/254906/2549061489249557.pdf">this short poem</a> by Susan Harlan.</p>

<h2>Guiding Principles<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#guiding-principles"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>I want you to succeed.</strong> The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. It is not here to “weed you out,” trick you, or discourage you. You (yes, <strong>you</strong>) can learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course.</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s still tough out there.</strong> Although some parts of our lives might be returning to normal, other parts remain affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these challenging times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your wellbeing comes first.</strong> If your wellbeing or that of a loved one comes into conflict with course obligations, I hope that you will prioritize the former.
I’ve included a considerable amount of flexibility in this course.
If you anticipate extended difficulties related to participation or assignments, reach out to me at the earliest opportunity.
We’ll find a path that prioritizes your wellbeing while still enabling you to succeed in the course.
I’ve given some examples below about some situations in which I hope you’ll reach out.</li>
<li>
<strong>We’ve got your back.</strong> As the instructor, I’m available to you through multiple channels. You also have an amazing support team—your TAs, LAs, and peers are all here to help you in your learning journey.</li>
</ol>

<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In this course:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You will relate mathematical definitions of network measures to intuitive, English-language descriptions of their meanings.</li>
<li>You will use “large graph limit” arguments to reason about the qualitative behavior of random and real-world graphs.</li>
<li>You will write programs to compute network measures, sample from random network models, simulate processes evolving on networks, and perform network data science tasks.</li>
<li>You will write both formal proofs and heuristic arguments to prove properties of network algorithms and models.</li>
<li>You will communicate mathematical arguments, experiments, and code in a professional format via the <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> mathematical markup language.</li>
<li>You will read and summarize classical and recent research papers in several distinct areas of network science.</li>
<li>
<strong>Beyond math</strong>: You will analyze, reflect on, and write about questions of bias, fairness, and justice in networked settings.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Beyond math</strong>: You will describe the abstractions and accompanying limitations of network models as descriptions of real-world phenomena.</li>

</h2>
<p>This section collects some considerations about “being a student” that go beyond the specific details of this particular course.</p>
<div id="the-hidden-curriculum" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The Hidden Curriculum<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-hidden-curriculum"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>hidden curriculum</em> refers to the implicit knowledge and habits—not usually taught explicitly—that students pick up “along the way” in their education. These often relate to asking for help, using available resources, and planning work. Often, students with college-educated parents are more comfortable in the hidden curriculum than first-generation college students. I’d like to make sure that <strong>everyone</strong> knows the following about my class.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>It’s never wrong to ask me for help.</strong> <br>
It is literally my job to help you succeed in this class. If at any time you’re concerned about your ability to keep up the pace, just reach out and we’ll see what we can do. I won’t always be able to give you exactly the support you request, but I will do my best. I’m more able to help you out if you <strong>approach me early</strong>, as soon as issues come up.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your wellbeing comes first.</strong> <br>
If you are experiencing circumstances that make it difficult for you to complete your work for this class—especially if those circumstances are health-related—please let me know. There are plenty of drops for Discussion and quizzes, and I will grant extensions on homework assignments with valid reasons. “I didn’t manage my time well this week” isn’t a valid reason (in this case I would suggest you use your one homework drop), but “I am sick,” “my internet is unreliable,” “I am changing housing,” etc. etc. are all appropriate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Student Hours are for you.</strong> <br>
Student Hours, often called “Office Hours” in other courses, are <strong>your time</strong>. Come by to ask questions, chat with me, or just work on homework. You don’t need a “reason” to come to Student Hours, and you shouldn’t worry about disturbing me. Again, it’s <strong>your time.</strong> I’ll be very happy to see you.</li>
<li>
<strong>You can ask me to advocate for you.</strong> <br>
This is most commonly related to letters of recommendation (see section “Advice and Letters of Recommendation”), but if there’s another way in which I can use my position to help you, let me know.</li>
<li>
<strong>If something is hard for you, that’s ok.</strong> <br>
Maybe you’re struggling on a problem. That’s good! I know it feels frustrating, but <em>that is where learning happens.</em> If you are having a hard time on a problem, please remember:
<ul>
<li>You are not the only one. I promise.</li>
<li>You are not a bad student.</li>
<li>You can still succeed in this class and in future endeavors involving programming.</li>
<li>Ask for help! You’ve got me, the TA, the LAs, and your classmates. We are all here for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s ok—actually, it’s awesome—to collaborate with your peers on homework.</strong> <br>
It’s not cheating to work together on homeworks (at least in this class). Make sure to credit your collaborators at the top of your assignment, and observe the considerations in the section “Collaboration and Academic Honesty.”</li>
</ul>
<p>To expand on one of the points above: if you are a first-gen student, I especially encourage you to reach out to me. I’ll offer you what tips I can about navigating your time at UCLA.</p>
</div>
<div id="prioritizing-your-wellbeing" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Prioritizing Your Wellbeing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prioritizing-your-wellbeing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the guiding principles of this course is that <strong>your wellbeing comes first.</strong>
If your wellbeing comes into conflict with the course obligations, I hope that you’ll prioritize your wellbeing and reach out to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you or someone you love is experiencing a <strong>health crisis</strong>, prioritize your wellbeing. You can use some of your drops to take a break from assignments, or you can also ask me for an extension or other accommodation.</li>
<li>If some aspect of the course is causing undue <strong>stress or anxiety</strong>, feel free to let me know. I regularly make adjustments to the course to promote student mental health while still meeting course learning objectives.</li>
<li>If you do not have <strong>reliable internet</strong> or other resources needed to access class resources, let me know and we’ll see what we can do.</li>
<li>If you are having trouble <strong>managing your time</strong>, feel free to ask me for advice. I don’t usually grant accommodations for this reason, but I may be able to help you use your time more efficiently in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples are not exhaustive. If you are in any situation in which you feel that your obligations to PIC16A are detrimental to your wellbeing or the wellbeing of someone you love, <strong>please consider contacting me.</strong> Please also remember that the sooner you approach me, the better I can help you.</p>
</div>
<div id="advice-and-letters-of-recommendation" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Advice and Letters of Recommendation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#advice-and-letters-of-recommendation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div id="advice" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Advice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#advice"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>I am always happy to talk with you about your future plans, including internships, REUs, and graduate school applications. Because I am a creature of the academy, I am less knowledgeable about industry jobs, although you are welcome to ask about those too.</p>
</div>
<div id="letters-of-recommendation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Letters of Recommendation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#letters-of-recommendation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>If you have completed a course with me or are currently enrolled, you are welcome to request a letter from me. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you – but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To request a letter, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/tL79wtFrfHC5Vspw7">this request form</a>! Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-i-wont-write-a-letter" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>When I Won’t Write a Letter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when-i-wont-write-a-letter"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);</li>
<li>Military applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);</li>
<li>Weapons manufacturing, broadly construed;</li>
<li>Intelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you’d like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn’t reflect on your ability to succeed in PIC16B, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/">Just Mathematics Collective</a> has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available <a href="https://justmathematicscollective.net/career_resources.html">here</a>. The text of this section is lightly modified from their <a href="https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/letter_writing.html">suggested text</a> on letter-writing.</p>
